Pachauri \net\xa0al.', '2014).', 'Leveraging the opportunities offered by AI for global cli-\nmate change is both feasible and desirable, but it involves \na sacrifice (ethical risks and potentially an increased car -\nbon footprint) in view of a very significant gain (a more \neffective response to climate change).', 'It is, in other words, \na gambit, which requires responsive and effective govern-\nance to become a winning strategy.', 'The overall aim of this \narticle is to contribute to the development of such a strategy.', 'We begin in Sect.', '2 by exploring the opportunities that AI \naffords for combatting climate change, identifying two cru-\ncial opportunities: AI can help improve and expand current \nunderstanding of climate change; and AI\xa0is increasingly part \nof a package of responses that are essential to combatting the \nclimate crisis effectively, by delivering much greener, more \nsustainable and effective solutions.', 'However, as we argue, \nthe introduction of AI into the climate domain risks amplify -\ning several social and ethical challenges already associated \nwith AI more generally, such as unfair bias, discrimination, \nor opacity in decision-making.', 'In Sect.', '3, we address the flipside of AI in the context of \nclimate change: the contribution to global climate change of \nthe greenhouse gases emitted by developing computation-\nintensive AI systems.', 'We focus on the carbon footprint of \nAI research, and assess the factors that influence AI’ s green-\nhouse gas (GHG) emissions in this context, finding that the \ncarbon footprint of AI research can be significant, and high-\nlighting the need for more scientific evidence concerning \nthe trade-off between the GHG emissions generated by AI \nresearch and the energy and resource efficiency gains that AI \noffers when applied to various tasks and industries.', 'In Sect.', '4, we turn to the wider policy context, and iden-\ntify the European Union as being especially well placed to \nadopt effective policy response to the opportunities and chal-\nlenges presented.', 'Thus, in Sect.', '5, we provide 13 recommen-\ndations for European policymakers and AI researchers that \nare designed to identify and harness the opportunities of AI \nfor combatting climate change, while reducing the impact \nof its development on the environment.', 'We conclude our analysis by stressing that risks and benefits of the uses of AI \nto fight climate change are distinct yet intertwined, and that \neffective policies and strategies are required to both lever -\nage the potential of AI and minimise the harms it poses to \nprotect the environment.', '2  AI against\xa0climate change\nAI is already having\xa0a significant positive impact in the \nfight against climate change.', 'Yet exactly how significant, \nand precisely what sort of impact, are challenging questions \nto answer.', 'This section provides an overview of initiatives \nand projects that rely on AI to understand and combat cli-\nmate change (1.1), notes work already done to document this \npotential positive impact of AI on climate change (1.2), and \nidentifies a set of obstacles to be overcome to ensure that the \nuse of AI to understand and combat climate change is not \nonly effective but also ethically sound (1.3).', '2.1  How AI is\xa0used against\xa0climate change\nAI may be characterised as a set of multipurpose tools and \ntechniques designed to simulate and/or improve upon pro-\ncesses that would have seemed intelligent had a human per -\nformed them (McCarthy et\xa0al.', '2006).', 'At a high level, key \ncognitive capabilities displayed by “intelligent”  machine \nsystems include a combination of classification, prediction, \nand decision-making.', 'These capabilities\xa0are already being \ndeployed in a diverse array of domains, like health (e.g., \nrecognising features in an image such as an X-ray scan for \ncancer diagnosis), transportation (e.g., using environmental \nsensors to safely drive a car), and communication (e.g., pro-\ncessing human speech and responding in kind).', 'Applying \nthe “solution space”  of AI to the “ problem space”  of climate \nchange could yield significant benefits, by, first, helping to \nunderstand the problem, and second, by facilitating effective \nresponses.', 'First, despite scientific consensus about the basic facts \nof climate change, many aspects of the environmental crisis \nremain uncertain.', 'This includes the explanation of past and \npresent events and observations, and the accurate prediction \nof future outcomes.', 'The ability of AI to process enormous \namounts of non-structured, multi-dimensional data using \nsophisticated optimisation techniques is already facilitat-\ning the understanding of high-dimensional climate datasets \nand forecasting of future trends (Huntingford et\xa0al.', '2019).', 'AI techniques have been used to forecast global mean tem-\nperature changes (Ise and Oba 2019; Cifuentes et\xa0al.', '2020); \npredict climactic and oceanic phenomena such as El Niño \n(Ham et\xa0al.', '2019 ), cloud systems (Rasp et\xa0al.', '2018 ), and \ntropical instability waves (Zheng et\xa0al.', '2020);

urban environments to economic, \nsocial, and political circumstances— and the Blue of \nour digital technologies, from mobile phones to social \nplatforms, from the Internet of Things to Big Data, \nfrom AI to future quantum computing” .', 'In this marriage, some risks, such as AI’ s carbon foot-\nprint, are not entirely avoidable, but they can certainly be \nminimised, to deliver the best strategies against climate \nchange.', 'This is why the right policies are key to harness the \nopportunities while ensuring that the risks are adequately \nassessed and minimised, as much as possible.', 'Harnessing the positive and mitigating the negative \nimpact of AI on the environment is achievable with the \nsupport of robust policymaking and of key stakeholders.', 'The formula of “ Green & Blue”  has never been more cen-\ntral to the European policymaking agenda, and the Recom-\nmendations outlined in this article can serve as a “ Green & \nBlue-print”  for a more sustainable society and a healthier \nbiosphere.', 'By shedding light on the use of AI to counter \nclimate change and offering recommendations to make \nthis use of AI ethically sound and sustainable, this article \naims to inform EU policy strategy for the ‘ twin transitions’ \nand help ensure that the marriage between the Green and \nthe Blue is a success that leads to a better society and a

Pachauri \net\xa0al.', '2014).', 'Leveraging the opportunities offered by AI for global cli-\nmate change is both feasible and desirable, but it involves \na sacrifice (ethical risks and potentially an increased car -\nbon footprint) in view of a very significant gain (a more \neffective response to climate change).', 'It is, in other words, \na gambit, which requires responsive and effective govern-\nance to become a winning strategy.', 'The overall aim of this \narticle is to contribute to the development of such a strategy.', 'We begin in Sect.', '2 by exploring the opportunities that AI \naffords for combatting climate change, identifying two cru-\ncial opportunities: AI can help improve and expand current \nunderstanding of climate change; and AI\xa0is increasingly part \nof a package of responses that are essential to combatting the \nclimate crisis effectively, by delivering much greener, more \nsustainable and effective solutions.', 'However, as we argue, \nthe introduction of AI into the climate domain risks amplify -\ning several social and ethical challenges already associated \nwith AI more generally, such as unfair bias, discrimination, \nor opacity in decision-making.', 'In Sect.', '3, we address the flipside of AI in the context of \nclimate change: the contribution to global climate change of \nthe greenhouse gases emitted by developing computation-\nintensive AI systems.', 'We focus on the carbon footprint of \nAI research, and assess the factors that influence AI’ s green-\nhouse gas (GHG) emissions in this context, finding that the \ncarbon footprint of AI research can be significant, and high-\nlighting the need for more scientific evidence concerning \nthe trade-off between the GHG emissions generated by AI \nresearch and the energy and resource efficiency gains that AI \noffers when applied to various tasks and industries.', 'In Sect.', '4, we turn to the wider policy context, and iden-\ntify the European Union as being especially well placed to \nadopt effective policy response to the opportunities and chal-\nlenges presented.', 'Thus, in Sect.', '5, we provide 13 recommen-\ndations for European policymakers and AI researchers that \nare designed to identify and harness the opportunities of AI \nfor combatting climate change, while reducing the impact \nof its development on the environment.', 'We conclude our analysis by stressing that risks and benefits of the uses of AI \nto fight climate change are distinct yet intertwined, and that \neffective policies and strategies are required to both lever -\nage the potential of AI and minimise the harms it poses to \nprotect the environment.', '2  AI against\xa0climate change\nAI is already having\xa0a significant positive impact in the \nfight against climate change.', 'Yet exactly how significant, \nand precisely what sort of impact, are challenging questions \nto answer.', 'This section provides an overview of initiatives \nand projects that rely on AI to understand and combat cli-\nmate change (1.1), notes work already done to document this \npotential positive impact of AI on climate change (1.2), and \nidentifies a set of obstacles to be overcome to ensure that the \nuse of AI to understand and combat climate change is not \nonly effective but also ethically sound (1.3).', '2.1  How AI is\xa0used against\xa0climate change\nAI may be characterised as a set of multipurpose tools and \ntechniques designed to simulate and/or improve upon pro-\ncesses that would have seemed intelligent had a human per -\nformed them (McCarthy et\xa0al.', '2006).', 'At a high level, key \ncognitive capabilities displayed by “intelligent”  machine \nsystems include a combination of classification, prediction, \nand decision-making.', 'These capabilities\xa0are already being \ndeployed in a diverse array of domains, like health (e.g., \nrecognising features in an image such as an X-ray scan for \ncancer diagnosis), transportation (e.g., using environmental \nsensors to safely drive a car), and communication (e.g., pro-\ncessing human speech and responding in kind).', 'Applying \nthe “solution space”  of AI to the “ problem space”  of climate \nchange could yield significant benefits, by, first, helping to \nunderstand the problem, and second, by facilitating effective \nresponses.', 'First, despite scientific consensus about the basic facts \nof climate change, many aspects of the environmental crisis \nremain uncertain.', 'This includes the explanation of past and \npresent events and observations, and the accurate prediction \nof future outcomes.', 'The ability of AI to process enormous \namounts of non-structured, multi-dimensional data using \nsophisticated optimisation techniques is already facilitat-\ning the understanding of high-dimensional climate datasets \nand forecasting of future trends (Huntingford et\xa0al.', '2019).', 'AI techniques have been used to forecast global mean tem-\nperature changes (Ise and Oba 2019; Cifuentes et\xa0al.', '2020); \npredict climactic and oceanic phenomena such as El Niño \n(Ham et\xa0al.', '2019 ), cloud systems (Rasp et\xa0al.', '2018 ), and \ntropical instability waves (Zheng et\xa0al.', '2020);
