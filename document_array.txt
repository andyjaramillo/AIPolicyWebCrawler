Pachauri et al.', '2014).Leveraging the opportunities offered by AI for global cli-mate change is both feasible and desirable, but it involves a sacrifice (ethical risks and potentially an increased car -bon footprint) in view of a very significant gain (a more effective response to climate change).', 'It is, in other words, a gambit, which requires responsive and effective govern-ance to become a winning strategy.', 'The overall aim of this article is to contribute to the development of such a strategy.', 'We begin in Sect.', '2 by exploring the opportunities that AI affords for combatting climate change, identifying two cru-cial opportunities: AI can help improve and expand current understanding of climate change; and AI is increasingly part of a package of responses that are essential to combatting the climate crisis effectively, by delivering much greener, more sustainable and effective solutions.', 'However, as we argue, the introduction of AI into the climate domain risks amplify -ing several social and ethical challenges already associated with AI more generally, such as unfair bias, discrimination, or opacity in decision-making.In Sect.', '3, we address the flipside of AI in the context of climate change: the contribution to global climate change of the greenhouse gases emitted by developing computation-intensive AI systems.', 'We focus on the carbon footprint of AI research, and assess the factors that influence AI’ s green-house gas (GHG) emissions in this context, finding that the carbon footprint of AI research can be significant, and high-lighting the need for more scientific evidence concerning the trade-off between the GHG emissions generated by AI research and the energy and resource efficiency gains that AI offers when applied to various tasks and industries.In Sect.', '4, we turn to the wider policy context, and iden-tify the European Union as being especially well placed to adopt effective policy response to the opportunities and chal-lenges presented.', 'Thus, in Sect.', '5, we provide 13 recommen-dations for European policymakers and AI researchers that are designed to identify and harness the opportunities of AI for combatting climate change, while reducing the impact of its development on the environment.', 'We conclude our analysis by stressing that risks and benefits of the uses of AI to fight climate change are distinct yet intertwined, and that effective policies and strategies are required to both lever -age the potential of AI and minimise the harms it poses to protect the environment.2  AI against climate changeAI is already having a significant positive impact in the fight against climate change.', 'Yet exactly how significant, and precisely what sort of impact, are challenging questions to answer.', 'This section provides an overview of initiatives and projects that rely on AI to understand and combat cli-mate change (1.1), notes work already done to document this potential positive impact of AI on climate change (1.2), and identifies a set of obstacles to be overcome to ensure that the use of AI to understand and combat climate change is not only effective but also ethically sound (1.3).2.1  How AI is used against climate changeAI may be characterised as a set of multipurpose tools and techniques designed to simulate and/or improve upon pro-cesses that would have seemed intelligent had a human per -formed them (McCarthy et al.', '2006).', 'At a high level, key cognitive capabilities displayed by “intelligent”  machine systems include a combination of classification, prediction, and decision-making.', 'These capabilities are already being deployed in a diverse array of domains, like health (e.g., recognising features in an image such as an X-ray scan for cancer diagnosis), transportation (e.g., using environmental sensors to safely drive a car), and communication (e.g., pro-cessing human speech and responding in kind).', 'Applying the “solution space”  of AI to the “ problem space”  of climate change could yield significant benefits, by, first, helping to understand the problem, and second, by facilitating effective responses.First, despite scientific consensus about the basic facts of climate change, many aspects of the environmental crisis remain uncertain.', 'This includes the explanation of past and present events and observations, and the accurate prediction of future outcomes.', 'The ability of AI to process enormous amounts of non-structured, multi-dimensional data using sophisticated optimisation techniques is already facilitat-ing the understanding of high-dimensional climate datasets and forecasting of future trends (Huntingford et al.', '2019).', 'AI techniques have been used to forecast global mean tem-perature changes (Ise and Oba 2019; Cifuentes et al.', '2020); predict climactic and oceanic phenomena such as El Niño (Ham et al.', '2019 ), cloud systems (Rasp et al.', '2018 ), and tropical instability waves (Zheng et al.', '2020); better under -stand aspects of the weather system—like rainfall, generally']

Xenochristou et al.', '2020 ).', 'AI tools can also help anticipate the extreme weather events that are more com-mon as a result of global climate change, for example heavy rain damage (Choi et al.', '2018) and wildfires (Jaafari et al.', '2019), and other downstream consequences, such as pat-terns of human migration (Robinson and Dilkina 2018).', 'In many cases, AI techniques can help to improve or expedite existing forecasting and prediction systems, for example by automatically labelling climate modelling data (Chattopad-hyay et al.', '2020), improving approximations for simulating the atmosphere (Gagne et al.', '2020), and separating signals from noise in climate observations (Barnes et al.', '2019).Second, combating climate change effectively requires a vast array of responses to the crisis, which broadly include both mitigating existing effects of climate change and reduc-ing emissions through decarbonisation to prevent further warming.', 'For example, a 2018 Microsoft/PwC report esti-mated that using AI for environmental applications could boost global GDP by between 3.1 and 4.4%, while reduc-ing greenhouse gas emissions anywhere from 1.5 to 4% by 2030 compared to a “business as usual” scenario (Microsoft 2018, 8).', 'An array of AI-based techniques already plays a key role in many of these responses (Inderwildi et al.', '2020; Sayed-Mouchaweh 2020).', 'This includes, for example, energy efficiency in industry, especially the petrochemi-cal sector (Narciso and Martins 2020).', 'Studies have also used AI to understand, at a high level, industrial pollution in China (Zhou et al.', '2016), the carbon footprint of con-crete used in construction (Thilakarathna et al.', '2020), and even energy efficiency in shipping (Perera et al.', '2016).', 'Other work has explored the use of AI in electrical grid manage-ment (Di Piazza et al.', '2020), to forecast building energy usage (Fathi et al.', '2020), and to assess the sustainability of food consumption (Abdella et al.', '2020).', 'Many of these studies involve showing the potential applicability of AI-based methods in silico and/or at a small scale.', 'However, the techniques presented could have considerable impact across society and the global economy if taken forward and scaled up.There are also examples where AI-based approaches can help improve the understanding of, and facilitate effective responses to, climate change— particularly in the policy-making domain.', 'For example, AI can help to predict carbon emissions based on present trends (Mardani et al.', '2020; Wei et al.', '2018), and help monitor the active removal of carbon from the atmosphere through sequestration (Menad et al.', '2019).', 'AI approaches have also been employed to assess the potential viability and impact of large-scale policy changes and other societal shifts.', 'This includes top-down policy ini-tiatives, such as carbon tax schemes (Abrell et al.', '2019) and carbon trading systems (Lu et al.', '2020), as well as detecting (Xiao et al.', '2019 ) and weighing the variables associated with different travel modes (Hagenauer and Helbich 2017), and optimising electric vehicle sharing (Miao et al.', '2019) and charging architecture (Tao et al.', '2018).', 'Each of these could in turn boost the availability and uptake of more climate-friendly transportation options.Beyond this indicative evidence, the growing use of AI to fight climate change can also be seen from the higher vantage point of major institutions and large-scale initiatives.', 'The European Lab for Learning & Intelligent Systems (ELLIS) has a Machine Learning for Earth and Climate Sciences pro-gramme that aims to “ model and understand the Earth sys-tem with Machine Learning and Process Understanding” .1 The European Space Agency has also established a Digital Twin Earth Challenge to provide “ forecasting on the impact of climate change and responding to societal challenges” .2 On the academic side, the EC-funded iMIRACLI (innova-tive MachIne leaRning to constrain Aerosol-cloud CLimate Impacts) initiative will support 15 PhD students across nine European universities to “ develop machine learning solu-tions to deliver a breakthrough in climate research” ,3 with doctoral projects underway since autumn 2020.Several European universities have initiatives and train-ing programmes dedicated to unlocking the power of AI for climate.4,5,6 Indeed, a search of Cordis— the European database for funded research— for current projects address-ing climate change and AI returned a total of 122 results.7 Analysis of these 122 projects suggests that they represent both geographic and disciplinary breadth.', 'The projects are well spread across the continent, albeit with a clear skew towards western Europe in terms of where they are coordi-nated (see Fig.', '1).', 'Figure  2 displays the top-level field(s) of study indicated for each of the projects, where this informa-tion was provided (n  = 106).', 'Unsurprisingly, a large majority of projects relate to the natural sciences and/or engineering and technology, but a considerable number are also anchored in social sciences.', 'And as Fig.', '3 shows, at a more granular level, the breadth of subjects that these projects touch on is 1 https:// ellis.', 'eu/ progr ams/ machi ne- learn ing- for- earth- and- clima te- scien ces.2 https:// coper nicus- maste rs.', 'com/ prize/ esa- chall enge/#.3 https:// imira cli.', 'web.', 'ox.', 'ac.', 'uk.4 https:// www.', 'uv.', 'es/ uvweb/ uv- news/ en/ news/ ai- under stand ing- model  ling- earth- system- inter natio nal- resea rch- team- co- led- unive rsity- valen  cia- wins- erc- syner gy- grant- 12859 73304 159/ Novet  at.', 'html.5 https:// www.', 'exeter.', 'ac.', 'uk/ resea rch/ envir onmen tal- intel ligen ce/.6 https:// ai4er- cdt.', 'esc.', 'cam.', 'ac.', "uk.7 Search of Cordis research project database conducted 30th Novem-ber 2020 of Projects with search string [('climate change' OR ‘global warming’) AND ('artificial intelligence' OR 'machine learning')], (n = 122)."]

Shehabi et al.', '2018; Jones 2018; Masanet et al.', '2020).', 'The International Energy Agency reports that, if current effi-ciency trends in hardware and data centre infrastructure can be maintained, global data centre energy demand— currently 1% of global electricity demand—“ can remain nearly flat through 2022, despite a 60% increase in service demand” (IEA 2020).', 'Indeed, significant efforts have been made to curb data centres’  carbon footprint by investing in energy-efficient infrastructure and switching to renewable sources of energy (Jones 2018; Masanet et al.', '2020).', 'Cloud providers especially, such as Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, have worked to keep their carbon footprint in check by commit-ting to renewable energy, improving cooling systems and efficient processors, recycling waste heat, and investing in carbon offsetting schemes (Jouhara and Meskimmon 2014; Avgerinou et al.', '2017; Jones 2018; Open Compute Project 2020).', 'In fact, both providers have leveraged AI to reduce the energy consumption of their data centres, in some cases by up to 40% (Evans and Gao 2016; Microsoft, C 2018).Whether these efforts keep pace with the growing demand for data centre services and whether efficiency gains are equally realised around the world will be crucial factors affecting the environmental impact of the sector.', 'These goals may not be easily achievable.', 'Even in the EU, where energy-efficient cloud computing has become a primary issue on the political agenda, the European Commission estimates a 28% increase in energy consumption of data centres by 2030 (European Commission 2020d).', 'Things are compli-cated even further by transparency concerns regarding the data required to calculate GHG emissions of on-premise data centres as well as cloud vendors, which will need to be addressed to obtain an accurate understanding of the carbon footprint of the ICT sector (Hintemann 2015 ; Mytton 2020 ; Hintemann and Hinterholzer 2020).At the same time, understanding the carbon footprint of AI involves more than just monitoring data centres, as the rest of this section will show (Henderson et al.', '2020; Cai et al.', '2020).', 'Given the wide range of artefacts and activities relying on some form of AI and the multi-layered production process of AI systems— spanning from data collection and storage, to hardware production and shipment, to AI/machine learning (ML) model trainings and inferences —gauging the carbon footprint of AI is challenging.', 'This is why this section focuses on the carbon footprint associated with the energy consumption of AI research activities, available in corresponding research publications.18 As we shall see in Sect.', '3.3, verifiable information on the short- and projected medium-term environmental impact of AI research activities is limited and suffers from a lack of systematic and accu-rate measurements.', 'However, the information contained in research publications regarding the energy consumption and carbon emission of AI is more accessible and testable than in industry reports.', 'Thus, it offers a more reliable starting point to understand the environmental impact of AI, even if it is indicative only of a subset of all AI-related activities.', 'Furthermore, to gauge the energy consumption and carbon footprint of AI research activities, it is important to distin-guish between two phases of computation that are central to supervised ML research methods: training (or “ learning” ) and inferences.', 'Training a ML model involves providing labelled sample data, or a “ training set” , to a ML algorithm so that it can “learn ” from it and create an appropriate math-ematical model with the optimal parameters that minimise a certain cost function (e.g.', 'some metric of error).', 'Once the training phase is finished, a model and its parameters are fixed and such model can be operationalised and produce actionable output on new, unseen data, which is the “ infer-ence”  process.In the short term, the training phase is computation-ally more demanding and energy intensive (Al-Jarrah et al.', '2015).', 'In the medium term, the energy consumption of the inference phase scales with usage, as inference can usually occur millions of times per day for an indefinite amount of time (Sze et al.', '2017).', 'So, training is often more energy-intensive in data-driven, ML-based research, while inference might be more energy-intensive in at-scale production sys-tems which may require non-stop usage.', 'This is why, in the context of AI as a whole, this article focuses on information pertaining to the research and training of AI models.Several approaches to monitoring and estimating the GHG emissions of AI research activities have been recently offered.', 'These include the reporting of floating point opera-tions (Lacoste et al.', '2019; Schwartz et al.', '2019; Hender -son et al.', '2020), hardware type and hardware burden or “processors multiplied by the computation rate and time” 17 A new standard (L.1470) set out by the ITU was recently devel-oped to keep the ICT industry in line with the Paris Agreement and reduce GHG emissions by 45% from 2020 to 2030 (ITU 2020).18 Over the past two decades, the number of data-driven AI confer -ences and publications has grown dramatically (Perrault et al.', '2019).', 'The volume of peer-reviewed AI papers increased by more than 300% from 1998 to 2018, while the number of publications on “Machine Learning” on the open-access archive “ArXiv” has doubled every 15  months since 2015 (Perrault et  al.', '2019).', 'This growth is also fuelled by an increasing amount of publications originating from the private sector—big technology companies in particular—with their seemingly limitless resources to conduct experiments (Perrault et al.', '2019, 17; Lohr 2019; Ahmed and Wahed 2020).']

on the environment is achievable with the support of robust policymaking and of key stakeholders.', 'The formula of “ Green & Blue”  has never been more cen-tral to the European policymaking agenda, and the Recom-mendations outlined in this article can serve as a “ Green & Blue-print”  for a more sustainable society and a healthier biosphere.', 'By shedding light on the use of AI to counter climate change and offering recommendations to make this use of AI ethically sound and sustainable, this article aims to inform EU policy strategy for the ‘ twin transitions’ and help ensure that the marriage between the Green and the Blue is a success that leads to a better society and a healthier planet.Acknowledgements The authors wish to acknowledge the invaluable com-ments provided during the
