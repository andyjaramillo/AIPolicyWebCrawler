a result,driverless cabs are expected to become cheaper and whicheventually may discourage car ownership.The concept of driverless taxis is analogous to car-sharing which is a thriving business model.', 'AVs can boostcar and ride sharing schemes as they can cater to multiplepersons on demand [ 1].', 'Consequently, households may ﬁnddriverless taxis more convenient and cheaper to hire thanowning a vehicle.', 'Furthermore, compared to car-sharing,driverless taxis should not be costlier.', 'Given the fact thatthe driverless taxi obviates the need for annual ﬁxed costsand maintenance normally associated with car-sharing aswell as parking, it would provide even greater convenience.In actual fact, car-sharing has recently been found to lowerVKT in the United States market [ 49].', 'Nevertheless, aspreviously mentioned, cheaper rides would be accompa-nied by new demands, especially from destitute (low-in-come) people who can now afford to either drive or to takea cab.A recent analysis of US household data shows a sig-niﬁcant reduction in vehicle ownership and an accompa-nying shift to vehicle sharing [ 50].', 'This reduction could beas high as 43 %—from 2.1 to 1.2 vehicles per household.Conversely, it is anticipated that this shift would inﬂateindividual vehicle usage up to 75 %, from 11,661 to 20,406miles per vehicle annually.', '(This increase in mileage doesnot factor in the additional miles generated during each‘‘return-to-home’’ trip.', ')All in all, AVs possess great potential to lower manycosts associated with private modes as they are likely toinstigate more trips, resulting in growth in VKT.', 'AVs mayalso instigate an emergence in driverless taxis for which theultimate effect on VKT is still unclear.5.4 AV and electric vehiclesEnvironmental concerns, together with higher oil prices inthe last decade have been the driving forces behind theemergence of Electric vehicle (EV) technology.', 'The EVsuffers from some operational drawbacks including a dis-tance-traveling capacity limited to the size and durabilityof the batteries.', 'It limits the EV to short-range travel andcan make the process of ﬁnding charging stations a matterof constant anxiety [ 51].In this context, one can ﬁnd natural and organic synergybetween shared AV ﬂeets and EV technology: a ﬂeet ofAVs can resolve the practical limitations of EVs includingtravel range anxiety, access to charging infrastructure, andcharging time management [ 52,51].Chen [ 53] has shown that ﬂeet-managed AVs relievesuch concerns based on real-time travel demand andestablished charging-station locations.', 'Their ﬁnancialanalysis suggests that the combined cost of charginginfrastructure, vehicle capital and maintenance, electricity,insurance, and registration for a ﬂeet of AVs ranges from$0.42 to $0.49 per occupied mile traveled.', 'Therefore,shared AV service can be offered at the equivalent per-milecost of private vehicle ownership for low-mileage house-holds.', 'As such, automated electric cars will likely becompetitive with current manually driven car-sharing ser-vices and signiﬁcantly less expensive than on-demanddriver-operated transportation services.5.5 Roads’ capacityAV technologies provide ﬁnely tuned acceleration-brakingmaneuvers at all times while constantly and tirelesslymonitoring the surrounding trafﬁc environment.', 'Therefore,AVs are able to cruise at higher speeds while maintainingshorter distances (lower headways).', 'Semiautonomousvehicles equipped with Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC)have already shown such a promising function [ 54].', 'Lowerheadways by a queue of AVs will not compromise safety,and hence, we are likely to see a platooning of AVs.', 'As aresult, the throughput of the roads (or capacity) will sig-niﬁcantly increase—some studies have estimated by up to5 times [ 55].', 'In some studies, the fact that AVs are con-nected has been exploited in signal control which hasresulted in much less delay at signals or equivalently higherroad capacity [ 46–48].5.6 Congestion pricingAs discussed earlier, the advanced technologies of AVsare supposed to provide an easing of trafﬁc circulationand lowering of travel costs which in turn may induceadditional travel demand.', 'Such a demand can be seen asboth a threat and an opportunity.', 'The threat arises fromthe fact that the additional travel demand may worsentrafﬁc congestion.', 'The additional demand is the result ofadditional investment (AVs) injected into the transportsystem.', 'Such concerns are becoming serious.', 'Forinstance, researchers at Delft University in the Nether-lands have advised the Dutch government to take mea-sures (e.g., travel demand management) to curb thegrowth of travel and subsequent externalities of theimpending AV technologies [ 56].If one intends to maintain demand at the same levels asprior to the emergence of AVs, then there is a legitimateopportunity to tap into the induced demand by means ofcongestion pricing.', 'The pricing can be set to the level atwhich the induced demand dissipates.', 'Congestion pricingAutonomous vehicles: challenges, opportunities, and future implications for transportation …

impact on theland-use pattern.', 'The value of land increases proportion-ally with its proximity to the central city where jobopportunities exist in many industries such as banking,ﬁnancial markets,

metropolitan regions.', 'In other words,AVs may result in the further growth of suburbs and mayeven push further into exurb areas.', 'In the completelyopposite scenario, AV technology obviates the acute needfor parking spaces meaning parking space in the heart ofcities can be freed up for other usage.', 'Therefore, AVscould end up stimulating urban growth in central districts,adding to the density of CBDs.', 'It is important to note thatparking facilities monopolize a big chunk of space inCBDs.', 'Shoup [ 58] estimated that the total area dedicatedto parking space is on average equivalent to about 31 % ofdistrict areas.In summary, the long-term expectation with the adop-tion of level 4 AVs is that one would likely see denserurban cores, more buildings and fewer parking spaces.', 'Atthe same time, AVs could lead to even greater dispersion oflow-density development in metropolitan fringe areasgiven the ability of owners to engage in other activitieswhile vehicles pilot themselves [ 7].5.9 Developing countriesThird world countries struggle with a lack of transportationinfrastructure, such as roads, bridges, and public transport,which is impeding their economic development.', 'Adoptionof AVs by these developing countries may spare them thecosts associated with expanding capital-intensive infras-tructure.', 'A similar paradigm was seen when developingcountries leap-frogged over to mobile phone technologywhich exempted them from expensive landline infrastruc-ture [ 7,59].5.10 Environment (energy and emission)Anderson et al.', '[ 7] have pointed out three factors uponwhich the impact of AVs on the environment would beeither positive or negative:•fuel efﬁciency of AVs,•carbon-intensity and life-cycle emissions of the fossilfuel used to power AVs, and•total change in VKT resulting from the use of AVs.We have previously discussed VKT.', 'In the next Section,we will elaborate on the fuel consumption and efﬁciency ofAVs.Regardless of the emergence of AVs, advances invehicle design and engine efﬁciency have substantiallydecreased fuel consumption.', 'In one estimation for pas-senger cars, fuel consumption was almost halved comparedto the ﬁgures seen 30 years ago [ 60].', 'The adoption of AVtechnology even at Levels 1, 2, and 3 will lead to optimizeddriving and technology, also called eco-driving.', 'Examplesof some basic technologies that result in eco-driving arecruise control and smooth and gradual acceleration anddeceleration.', 'Eco-driving is proving to enhance fueleconomy by 4 % to 10 % [ 61].', 'More optimistic predictionshave envisaged an increase in fuel efﬁciency of up to 39 %[62].', 'We have also previously discussed that AVs may leadto a higher travel capacity and a reduction in fuel wastageduring times of trafﬁc congestion.AVs also provide an opportunity for vehicles to com-municate their maneuvers and actions with each otherwhich may reduce idle time, improving both trafﬁc anddrive-cycle efﬁciencies [ 7].', 'Furthermore, a platoon ofclosely spaced AVs that stops or slows down less often willresemble a train.', 'The result is expected to result in lowerpeak speeds (improving fuel economy) but higher effectivespeeds (improving travel time) [ 63,64].From a completely different perspective, the increasedlevel of safety of AVs may lead to lightweight vehiclesfrom car manufacturers.', 'In fact, safety efforts are beingdirected towards accident avoidance and away from old-fashioned crashworthiness cars.', 'Therefore, light vehiclesare promising by-products of AV technology which in turngreatly contributes to less fuel consumption.', 'For conven-tional vehicles, up to 20 % of the weight is attributed tosafety-related features [ 61].', 'As an engineering rule-of-thumb, a 10-percent reduction in weight can lead to a 6- to7-percent reduction in fuel consumption [ 7,65,66,67]).290 S.

authorities,and, to some extent, academic scholars is to forecast thefuture demand of AVs.', 'A recent and comprehensive reviewon the subject was presented by Bansal and Kockelman[68].', 'These predictions were based on the extrapolation oftrends derived from previous vehicle technologies, expertopinions, and forecasts of supply-side variables with verylittle emphasis on the underlying assumptions behind thesepredictions.As noted earlier, [ 13] foresees 50 % of the worldwidecar market being attributed to AVs by 2040.', 'According toone estimate [ 69], the market share of Levels 2 and 3automated vehicles will total some USD 87 billion.', 'Theseestimations or predictions vary substantially.', 'Other studiestake a much more optimistic view on the matter [see thediscussion provided by Bansal and Kockelman [ 68]].It is safe to state that given the ongoing investment inAV technology by the giant car manufacturers, the carmarket could soon be supplied by ﬁrst generation AVs.How large this move would be is difﬁcult to predict;however, it is likely to be signiﬁcant enough to warrant theundivided attention of those involved in the planningphase.In the preceding section, we covered themes directlyrelated to the transportation policies.', 'The AV however hasfar-reaching implications.', 'In Appendix 2, we discuss someadditional advantages and disadvantages of AVs includingmachine ethics, cybersecurity, and laws and regulation.6 AV navigation model14It is a matter of when AVs will be seen in the road network,and not if.', 'Thus, they are an important part of transporta-tion planning which requires the development of theappropriate models.', 'The ﬁnal stage of transportationmodeling is the simulation of vehicle movements in theroad network which is known as trafﬁc assignment.', 'To thatend, there are two major simulations: micro and macro.', 'Inmicro-simulation, detailed movements and behaviors of theindividual vehicles are taken into account in any analysis.The early and basic features of automation (Levels 1 and 2)have prompted some scholars to include AV technologiesinto micro-simulations [ 70–73].', 'As noted above, the con-nectedness of AVs has been investigated in signal controlpolicies which resulted in signiﬁcant reductions in delay[46–48].', 'Other studies tend to extend the reach of theexisting dynamic trafﬁc assignment models to somehowinclude AVs [ 71,74,75].', 'Despite current computationaltechnologies and current modeling knowledge, the scale ofmicro-simulation is limited to a portion of a city and notthe entire city.In contrast, macro-simulation easily encompasses largesized road networks.', 'This section is devoted to a newmacro-simulation to explicitly take a combination of AVsand non-AVs into consideration.The fact that AVs must be connected—although thisseems restrictive—can also be greatly exploited as anopportunity towards better vehicle routing.', 'Vehicle routingrefers to the way that vehicles seek their routes to get totheir destinations.', 'A common belief or model is based onthe shortest path.', 'In such a paradigm (also known asWardropian principles), each vehicle ‘‘selﬁshly’’ choosesits own shortest possible path irrespective of other vehi-cles’ choices.', 'This leads to an equilibrium condition calledUser Equilibrium (UE), a situation where no vehicle canunilaterally ﬁnd a shorter path.', 'This selﬁshness will likelyresult in ﬁnal trafﬁc patterns known as non-cooperative.Since vehicles have no knowledge of the other vehicles’routes and destinations, the non-cooperative trafﬁc patternis the most widely recognized trafﬁc model.', 'In other words,when one is driving, he/she is completely unaware ofneither where other vehicles are heading nor the routes thatthey are likely to take.', 'In contrast, the cooperative trafﬁcpattern assumes that the vehicles are aware of each other’sdestinations and routes.', 'It has been shown both theoreti-cally and empirically that the cooperative trafﬁc pattern ismore desirable than the non-cooperative trafﬁc pattern,possibly by a factor of 2 [ 76,77].', 'It has also been shownthat if a number of selﬁsh cars were to collaborate, it maystill result in a trafﬁc pattern much superior to the selﬁsh,non-cooperative pattern [ 78–80].14The navigation subject presented here is based on a macro viewon how the AVs choose (or assign) routes.', 'This subject differsfrom how an individual AV cruises through trafﬁc by maneuvers,waving, acceleration/deceleration, etc., which is called ‘‘longitudinalcontrol of an autonomous vehicle on the highway’’ (see Lefe `vre et al.2015.', 'Autonomous car following: a learning-based approach, intel-ligent vehicles symposium (IV), 2015 IEEE.', 'IEEE, pp.', '920–926.).', 'Insuch a domain, given a

a result,driverless cabs are expected to become cheaper and whicheventually may discourage car ownership.The concept of driverless taxis is analogous to car-sharing which is a thriving business model.', 'AVs can boostcar and ride sharing schemes as they can cater to multiplepersons on demand [ 1].', 'Consequently, households may ﬁnddriverless taxis more convenient and cheaper to hire thanowning a vehicle.', 'Furthermore, compared to car-sharing,driverless taxis should not be costlier.', 'Given the fact thatthe driverless taxi obviates the need for annual ﬁxed costsand maintenance normally associated with car-sharing aswell as parking, it would provide even greater convenience.In actual fact, car-sharing has recently been found to lowerVKT in the United States market [ 49].', 'Nevertheless, aspreviously mentioned, cheaper rides would be accompa-nied by new demands, especially from destitute (low-in-come) people who can now afford to either drive or to takea cab.A recent analysis of US household data shows a sig-niﬁcant reduction in vehicle ownership and an accompa-nying shift to vehicle sharing [ 50].', 'This reduction could beas high as 43 %—from 2.1 to 1.2 vehicles per household.Conversely, it is anticipated that this shift would inﬂateindividual vehicle usage up to 75 %, from 11,661 to 20,406miles per vehicle annually.', '(This increase in mileage doesnot factor in the additional miles generated during each‘‘return-to-home’’ trip.', ')All in all, AVs possess great potential to lower manycosts associated with private modes as they are likely toinstigate more trips, resulting in growth in VKT.', 'AVs mayalso instigate an emergence in driverless taxis for which theultimate effect on VKT is still unclear.5.4 AV and electric vehiclesEnvironmental concerns, together with higher oil prices inthe last decade have been the driving forces behind theemergence of Electric vehicle (EV) technology.', 'The EVsuffers from some operational drawbacks including a dis-tance-traveling capacity limited to the size and durabilityof the batteries.', 'It limits the EV to short-range travel andcan make the process of ﬁnding charging stations a matterof constant anxiety [ 51].In this context, one can ﬁnd natural and organic synergybetween shared AV ﬂeets and EV technology: a ﬂeet ofAVs can resolve the practical limitations of EVs includingtravel range anxiety, access to charging infrastructure, andcharging time management [ 52,51].Chen [ 53] has shown that ﬂeet-managed AVs relievesuch concerns based on real-time travel demand andestablished charging-station locations.', 'Their ﬁnancialanalysis suggests that the combined cost of charginginfrastructure, vehicle capital and maintenance, electricity,insurance, and registration for a ﬂeet of AVs ranges from$0.42 to $0.49 per occupied mile traveled.', 'Therefore,shared AV service can be offered at the equivalent per-milecost of private vehicle ownership for low-mileage house-holds.', 'As such, automated electric cars will likely becompetitive with current manually driven car-sharing ser-vices and signiﬁcantly less expensive than on-demanddriver-operated transportation services.5.5 Roads’ capacityAV technologies provide ﬁnely tuned acceleration-brakingmaneuvers at all times while constantly and tirelesslymonitoring the surrounding trafﬁc environment.', 'Therefore,AVs are able to cruise at higher speeds while maintainingshorter distances (lower headways).', 'Semiautonomousvehicles equipped with Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC)have already shown such a promising function [ 54].', 'Lowerheadways by a queue of AVs will not compromise safety,and hence, we are likely to see a platooning of AVs.', 'As aresult, the throughput of the roads (or capacity) will sig-niﬁcantly increase—some studies have estimated by up to5 times [ 55].', 'In some studies, the fact that AVs are con-nected has been exploited in signal control which hasresulted in much less delay at signals or equivalently higherroad capacity [ 46–48].5.6 Congestion pricingAs discussed earlier, the advanced technologies of AVsare supposed to provide an easing of trafﬁc circulationand lowering of travel costs which in turn may induceadditional travel demand.', 'Such a demand can be seen asboth a threat and an opportunity.', 'The threat arises fromthe fact that the additional travel demand may worsentrafﬁc congestion.', 'The additional demand is the result ofadditional investment (AVs) injected into the transportsystem.', 'Such concerns are becoming serious.', 'Forinstance, researchers at Delft University in the Nether-lands have advised the Dutch government to take mea-sures (e.g., travel demand management) to curb thegrowth of travel and subsequent externalities of theimpending AV technologies [ 56].If one intends to maintain demand at the same levels asprior to the emergence of AVs, then there is a legitimateopportunity to tap into the induced demand by means ofcongestion pricing.', 'The pricing can be set to the level atwhich the induced demand dissipates.', 'Congestion pricingAutonomous vehicles: challenges, opportunities, and future implications for transportation …

en-route.', 'Asa result, AVs further reduce the opportunity cost of travelin terms of the saved value of time pertaining to off-wheelactivities [ 7].5.8 Land useAVs may have a profound and prolonged impact on theland-use pattern.', 'The value of land increases proportion-ally with its proximity to the central city where jobopportunities exist in many industries such as banking,ﬁnancial markets, and many other service areas.', 'Proximityis manifested by transportation.', 'The advent of automobilesin the beginning of the 20th century resulted in theemergence of suburbs.', 'The relation between AVs and landuse is both complicated and somehow paradoxical.', 'In onescenario, the introduction of AVs could invigorate a trendtowards even more dispersed and low-density land-usepatterns surrounding metropolitan regions.', 'In other words,AVs may result in the further growth of suburbs and mayeven push further into exurb areas.', 'In the completelyopposite scenario, AV technology obviates the acute needfor parking spaces meaning parking space in the heart ofcities can be freed up for other usage.', 'Therefore, AVscould end up stimulating urban growth in central districts,adding to the density of CBDs.', 'It is important to note thatparking facilities monopolize a big chunk of space inCBDs.', 'Shoup [ 58] estimated that the total area dedicatedto parking space is on average equivalent to about 31 % ofdistrict areas.In summary, the long-term expectation with the adop-tion of level 4 AVs is that one would likely see denserurban cores, more buildings and fewer parking spaces.', 'Atthe same time, AVs could lead to even greater dispersion oflow-density development in metropolitan fringe areasgiven the ability of owners to engage in other activitieswhile vehicles pilot themselves [ 7].5.9 Developing countriesThird world countries struggle with a lack of transportationinfrastructure, such as roads, bridges, and public transport,which is impeding their economic development.', 'Adoptionof AVs by these developing countries may spare them thecosts associated with expanding capital-intensive infras-tructure.', 'A similar paradigm was seen when developingcountries leap-frogged over to mobile phone technologywhich exempted them from expensive landline infrastruc-ture [ 7,59].5.10 Environment (energy and emission)Anderson et al.', '[ 7] have pointed out three factors uponwhich the impact of AVs on the environment would beeither positive or negative:•fuel efﬁciency of AVs,•carbon-intensity and life-cycle emissions of the fossilfuel used to power AVs, and•total change in VKT resulting from the use of AVs.We have previously discussed VKT.', 'In the next Section,we will elaborate on the fuel consumption and efﬁciency ofAVs.Regardless of the emergence of AVs, advances invehicle design and engine efﬁciency have substantiallydecreased fuel consumption.', 'In one estimation for pas-senger cars, fuel consumption was almost halved comparedto the ﬁgures seen 30 years ago [ 60].', 'The adoption of AVtechnology even at Levels 1, 2, and 3 will lead to optimizeddriving and technology, also called eco-driving.', 'Examplesof some basic technologies that result in eco-driving arecruise control and smooth and gradual acceleration anddeceleration.', 'Eco-driving is proving to enhance fueleconomy by 4 % to 10 % [ 61].', 'More optimistic predictionshave envisaged an increase in fuel efﬁciency of up to 39 %[62].', 'We have also previously discussed that AVs may leadto a higher travel capacity and a reduction in fuel wastageduring times of trafﬁc congestion.AVs also provide an opportunity for vehicles to com-municate their maneuvers and actions with each otherwhich may reduce idle time, improving both trafﬁc anddrive-cycle efﬁciencies [ 7].', 'Furthermore, a platoon ofclosely spaced AVs that stops or slows down less often willresemble a train.', 'The result is expected to result in lowerpeak speeds (improving fuel economy) but higher effectivespeeds (improving travel time) [ 63,64].From a completely different perspective, the increasedlevel of safety of AVs may lead to lightweight vehiclesfrom car manufacturers.', 'In fact, safety efforts are beingdirected towards accident avoidance and away from old-fashioned crashworthiness cars.', 'Therefore, light vehiclesare promising by-products of AV technology which in turngreatly contributes to less fuel consumption.', 'For conven-tional vehicles, up to 20 % of the weight is attributed tosafety-related features [ 61].', 'As an engineering rule-of-thumb, a 10-percent reduction in weight can lead to a 6- to7-percent reduction in fuel consumption [ 7,65,66,67]).290 S.

authorities,and, to some extent, academic scholars is to forecast thefuture demand of AVs.', 'A recent and comprehensive reviewon the subject was presented by Bansal and Kockelman[68].', 'These predictions were based on the extrapolation oftrends derived from previous vehicle technologies, expertopinions, and forecasts of supply-side variables with verylittle emphasis on the underlying assumptions behind thesepredictions.As noted earlier, [ 13] foresees 50 % of the worldwidecar market being attributed to AVs by 2040.', 'According toone estimate [ 69], the market share of Levels 2 and 3automated vehicles will total some USD 87 billion.', 'Theseestimations or predictions vary substantially.', 'Other studiestake a much more optimistic view on the matter [see thediscussion provided by Bansal and Kockelman [ 68]].It is safe to state that given the ongoing investment inAV technology by the giant car manufacturers, the carmarket could soon be supplied by ﬁrst generation

includingmachine ethics, cybersecurity, and laws and regulation.6 AV navigation model14It is a matter of when AVs will be seen in the road network,and not if.', 'Thus, they are an important part of transporta-tion planning which requires the development of theappropriate models.', 'The ﬁnal stage of transportationmodeling is the simulation of vehicle movements in theroad network which is known as trafﬁc assignment.', 'To thatend, there are two major simulations: micro and macro.', 'Inmicro-simulation, detailed movements and behaviors of theindividual vehicles are taken into account in any analysis.The early and basic features of automation (Levels 1 and 2)have prompted some scholars to include AV technologiesinto micro-simulations [ 70–73].', 'As noted above, the con-nectedness of AVs

contrast, macro-simulation easily encompasses largesized road networks.', 'This section is devoted to a newmacro-simulation to explicitly take a combination of AVsand non-AVs into consideration.The fact that AVs must be connected—although thisseems restrictive—can also be greatly exploited as anopportunity towards better vehicle routing.', 'Vehicle routingrefers to the way that vehicles seek their routes to get totheir destinations.', 'A common belief or model is based onthe shortest path.', 'In such a paradigm (also known asWardropian principles), each vehicle ‘‘selﬁshly’’ choosesits own shortest possible path irrespective of other vehi-cles’ choices.', 'This leads to an equilibrium condition calledUser Equilibrium (UE), a situation where no vehicle canunilaterally ﬁnd a shorter path.', 'This selﬁshness will likelyresult in ﬁnal trafﬁc patterns known as non-cooperative.Since vehicles have no knowledge of the other vehicles’routes and destinations, the non-cooperative trafﬁc patternis the most widely recognized trafﬁc model.', 'In other words,when one is driving, he/she is completely unaware ofneither where other vehicles are heading nor the routes thatthey are likely to take.', 'In contrast, the cooperative trafﬁcpattern assumes that the vehicles are aware of each other’sdestinations and routes.', 'It has been shown both theoreti-cally and empirically that the
