Key Takeaways from the 2021 
AR/VR Policy Conference

NOVEMBER 2021
itif.orgINFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION FOUNDATION 1Augmented and virtual reality technologies 
(AR/VR), also known as extended reality 
(XR)—immersive technologies that enable 
users to experience digitally rendered content 
in both physical and virtual spaces—have 
the potential to transform the ways in which 
people communicate, work, and learn. No 
longer just for niche enthusiasts or high-tech 
industries, these technologies are already 
being used across sectors to overcome 
physical space barriers and enhance how 
individuals can interact with the world 
around them.
As AR/VR technologies proliferate across 
homes, workplaces, classrooms, and other 
aspects of everyday life, they raise unique 
considerations for policymakers. To bring 
these considerations to the forefront of policy 
debates, the Information Technology and 
Innovation Foundation partnered with the XR 
Association to host a half-day Augmented and 
Virtual Reality Policy Conference on October 21, 2021. The conference brought together 
21 speakers from across sectors and industries 
to discuss key considerations and potential 
recommendations for policymakers as we move 
toward a more immersive future.
Awareness and interest in the power and 
potential of AR/VR are certainly growing 
among policymakers. For example, the 2021 
U.S. Innovation and Competition Act identifies 
“immersive technology” as one of 10 key 
technology focus areas. The VR TECHS Act, 
introduced in 2019, proposed creating a 
“Federal Advisory Committee on the Usability 
of Reality Technologies Within the Federal 
Government.” And the Congressional Caucus 
on Virtual, Augmented, and Mixed Realities 
was formed in 2017 to enable members “to 
educate [their] colleagues and others to ensure 
Congress is doing all it can to encourage—
rather than hinder—these enterprising fields.” 
However, AR/VR technologies and their 
applications are rarely considered in broader 
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION FOUNDATION 2discussions of key policy issues, including 
privacy, security, online safety, and the future 
of education and work.
Through a series of expert talks and panels, 
speakers at the AR/VR Policy Conference 
provided a glimpse at what a policy agenda for 
an immersive future might look like. This post 
reviews some of the key takeaways from these 
discussions.
A full recording of the event is available on the 
conference website at www.arvrpolicy.org.
AR/VR SOLUTIONS HAVE 
WIDE-RANGING POTENTIAL
Across industries and areas of expertise, 
speakers agreed the potential of immersive 
technologies extends well beyond gaming and 
entertainment. AR/VR has the potential to 
enhance businesses as well as public services 
and expand economic and social opportunities 
for individuals. 
One of the most promising areas for AR/
VR solutions is training and education. For 
example, David Vasko , Director of Advanced 
Technology at Rockwell Automation, illustrated 
how immersive technologies can allow existing 
employees as well as college students to gain 
experience in digital replicas of factories and 
reduce the need for travel or relocation. Jeremy 
Bailenson , Founding Director of 
the Stanford Virtual Human Interaction Lab 
(VHIL), similarly named training as the “home 
run” use case that could accelerate adoption 
of AR/VR. 
As an example, his company Strivr provided 
Walmart with immersive training solutions 
that resulted in 30 percent higher employee 
satisfaction and up to 15 percent higher 
knowledge retention rate. 
These benefits extend to younger learners as 
well: both Raul Carvaja l, Director of Production 
and XR for Change at Games for Change, and 
Michael Preston , CEO of the Joan Ganz Cooney 
“We’re at an exciting point in 
time where we can now more fully 
understand the exceptional uses 
and applications of augmented, 
mixed, and virtual reality.” 
 
– Elizabeth Hyman, President and CEO, 
XR Association
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION FOUNDATION 3Center at Sesame Workshop, noted that AR/VR 
experiences can offer enriching and engaging 
experiences for kids both individually and in 
classroom settings.
Another key application for AR/VR is 
communication and collaboration. Jeremy 
Bailenson noted that the Stanford VHIL has 
done research on this subject, including the 
unique ability of VR to translate non-verbal 
communications more realistically than two-
dimensional videoconferencing. And Scott 
Evans , Vice President for Mixed Reality at 
Microsoft, agreed that video-based platforms 
“will evolve into much more immersive and 
3D collaborative environments that allow us 
to connect across physical barriers and spatial 
barriers in ways that we haven’t had in 
the past.” 
Immersive solutions can also 
expand opportunities and 
create new avenues for 
inclusion. For example, 
“tools powered by [AR/
VR] can help people with 
disabilities succeed by 
experiencing environments, 
learning new skills, and 
participating in new ways in the 
workplace,” explained Bill Curtis-
Davidson , co-director of the Partnership 
on Employment and Accessible 
Technology. And while “VR is not a magic tool 
where you put on the medium and suddenly 
racism, sexism, [and] ageism goes away,” 
noted Jeremy Bailenson of Stanford VHIL, 
the technology can “[give] you a very intense 
experience where you can be in a situation you 
wouldn’t be in otherwise.”
PRIVACY AND DATA 
GOVERNANCE SHOULD BE A 
PRIORITY
To reach the full potential of these 
technologies, many speakers argued, there 
are unique questions about privacy that policymakers and the companies building AR/
VR technologies will have to address. AR/VR 
devices require a large amount of information 
about individuals and their surroundings 
in order to deliver immersive, engaging 
experiences. As Joan O’Hara , Vice President 
for Public Policy at the XR Association noted, 
“we’re already dealing with these challenges 
in two dimensions, but this ups the ante 
a bit.”
Data stewardship was the foremost concern 
for many speakers. As experts deeply familiar 
with these technologies, they recognized that 
the amount of information they gather—and 
what can be inferred from that data—requires 
strong data protection and privacy measures. 
For example, users should clearly understand 
how biometric data, such as motion tracking or 
eye tracking, is used, and companies gathering 
that data should ensure they have measures 
in place to protect that information from 
unauthorized third parties.
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION FOUNDATION 4 
Many speakers argued that the unique privacy 
considerations that these technologies present 
make a case for a comprehensive national 
privacy law that puts necessary guardrails in 
place and provides a foundation for companies 
developing these and other new technologies 
to build from. “It would make sense for a 
privacy law to be tech-agnostic so that it can 
be impactful in the future,” noted Jeremy 
Greenberg , Policy Counsel at the Future 
of Privacy Forum. In her remarks, Reality 
Caucus Co-Chair Representative Suzan DelBene 
also raised concerns that others will fill in 
regulatory gaps if the U.S. does not move 
quickly on privacy legislation. “We won’t be 
able to shape standards abroad,” she warned, 
“and we risk others driving global policy.”
AN IMMERSIVE FUTURE 
RAISES UNIQUE SAFETY AND 
SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
In addition to mitigating potential privacy 
harms, speakers highlighted the need to 
consider other safety and security implications of AR/VR devices and applications. Several 
raised concerns about the potential 
for both physical and emotional harms when 
the physical world can be altered or replaced 
entirely by digitally rendered content. “There 
becomes this possibility that your reality 
can be manipulated,” said Jessica Outlaw , 
Research Director at the Extended Mind. On 
the one hand, this creates physical safety 
concerns: imagine, for example, that an AR 
application shows it is safe to cross the street 
by obscuring the user’s view of oncoming 
traffic. On the other hand, it also presents 
less tangible safety concerns by creating new 
channels for harassment or defamation. And, 
as Jeremy Greenberg of the Future of Privacy 
Forum noted, there are also valid concerns 
around mental health and addiction as 
physical and virtual reality overlap but never 
fully converge. 
“Work is far more remote, far 
more hybrid than it has ever 
been. AR and [VR] create an 
immersive experience where most 
people still feel like they are with 
their colleagues.” 
 
– Chike Aguh, Chief Innovation Officer, 
U.S. Department of Labor
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION FOUNDATION 5All of these concerns are particularly relevant 
when it comes to child safety. Many speakers 
cautioned that, as AR/VR technologies become 
more present in homes, classrooms, and other 
aspects of everyday life for all ages, it will be 
important to establish guardrails that protect 
children’s physical and emotional wellbeing 
across these experiences. Jeremy Bailenson of 
Stanford VHIL also raised this concern, noting 
that child safety remains a notable knowledge 
gap in our understanding of the impacts of 
immersive technologies.
In addition to personal security, Ash M. 
Richter , Senior Technology Architect at 
In-Q-Tel, argued that AR/VR technologies 
could also have implications for national 
security. “What we’re talking about is a new 
mechanism for recording our history as a 
species,” she argued, and “if we’re not there 
at the conversations for how to even ensure 
the record stays intact … then we’re ceding 
a very big security component on top of all 
of the economic pieces attached to this.” 
It is not difficult to imagine how adversarial 
actors could take advantage of the reality-
altering capabilities of these technologies if 
necessary security protections are not in place. 
Similar concerns arise from capabilities such 
as deepfakes, which can fabricate recorded 
images or video—but AR/VR can present 
falsified realities in real-time. For example, 
digital overlays could be altered to make a 
person appear somewhere they are not or 
even to distort the information that military 
personnel or officials receive on the ground 
during a crisis.
ACCESSIBILITY AND 
INCLUSION ARE 
FOUNDATIONAL TO 
SUCCESSFUL INNOVATION
As conversations unfolded around the power 
and potential of these technologies, ensuring 
equitable access and inclusive design from the 
start was a central theme. Many speakers saw 
this as an opportunity to build technologies that benefit as many people as possible from 
the outset—rather than scrambling to expand 
access or build in accessibility features after 
the fact. 
“There’s a massive responsibility 
to keep these technologies safe 
and ensure that the public has 
visibility over how their data is 
used and managed.” 
 
– Raul Carvajal, Director of 
Production and XR for Change, Games 
for Change
 
 
“These technologies are going to be 
everywhere … but we cannot leave people 
behind in terms of being educated and 
participating in society,” argued Bill Curtis-
Davidson of the Partnership on Employment 
and Accessible Technology.
Speakers from the public sector, industry, and 
civil society largely agreed that if accessibility 
and inclusive design are seen as an imperative 
at this early stage, this will ultimately lead to 
more widespread adoption and opportunities 
to drive innovation. For example, Chike Aguh 
of the U.S. Department of Labor highlighted 
the importance of equity, accessibility, and 
inclusion in designing AR/VR solutions that 
can expand economic opportunity by making 
workplaces more accessible to those who 
might face mobility constraints.INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION FOUNDATION 6“Often the necessary protections 
for kids are applied only to 
products designed for kids, rather 
than products designed for adults 
that kids happen to adopt.” 
 
–– Michael Preston, Executive Director, 
Joan Ganz Cooney Center at Sesame 
Workshop
This means designing both for and with people 
with diverse needs, including people with 
disabilities, different demographic groups 
(such as age, race, and gender), and people 
from different cultural or socioeconomic 
backgrounds. “It’s important to think about 
who is in the room when the content and the 
tools are being designed,” said Chike Aguh, 
arguing that “it is important to look at what—
and who—do your design teams look like?” 
Indeed, as Bill Curtis-Davidson noted, people 
using technologies that were not designed for 
them—such as people with disabilities—have 
developed innovative “life-hacking” skills that 
could inform inclusive product design.
In addition to devices that are physically 
useable for a diverse set of individuals, 
many speakers highlighted the importance of 
ensuring equitable access, particularly for key 
use cases such as work and education. “Many 
organizations that would be able to take 
advantage of [AR/VR] simply don’t know how 
they would viably fund some of the hardware 
implementation, let alone the development of any custom software,” noted Raul Carvajal of 
Games for Change. Many speakers highlighted 
the importance of engaging with stakeholder 
communities to achieve more equitable 
access—for example, as Michael Preston 
of the Joan Ganz Cooney Center proposed, 
partnering with schools to directly reach 
diverse students.
Noble Ackerson , President of the CyberXR 
Initiative, acknowledged that there will be 
some disparities in access even with the best 
efforts to avoid them. But just as cell phones 
went from costly (and somewhat cumbersome) 
luxury items to a utility that billions around 
the world rely on, he believes that AR/VR 
devices will reach a point where they could 
benefit a significant portion of the population 
if policies and initiatives are in place to drive 
equitable adoption.
LOOKING AHEAD: 
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR 
BUILDING AN IMMERSIVE 
FUTURE
AR/VR technologies clearly present 
enormous potential; and they raise 
unique considerations. How, then, should 
policymakers proceed to build an immersive 
future that positively impacts people’s lives? 
As Stephen Yadzinski , Senior Innovation Officer 
at Jobs for the Future argued, “we have to 
hurry up on these issues a little bit to make 
sure we don’t fall behind in terms of what the 
right solution might be.” Over the course of 
the event, speakers identified several actions 
that policymakers and other stakeholders can 
take to address this urgency.
First, it is clear that this conversation should 
be a collaborative effort among policymakers, 
industry leaders, civil society, and current and 
potential users across diverse communities. 
“At times with emerging technologies, 
companies feel like they have to make it up 
on their own,” observed Chike Aguh of the 
Department of Labor. He added, “I think INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION FOUNDATION 7that to the extent that we can bring all parties 
together and create some rules of the road 
… you’ll increase adoption and remove some 
of the pitfalls that we’ve seen with prior 
emerging technologies.” As the technology 
continues to evolve, established guidelines 
and best practices will allow companies to 
continue to innovate with these considerations 
in mind. For example, Susan Persky , Director 
of the Immersive Simulation Program at 
the National Institutes of Health’s Human 
Genome Research Institute, emphasized the 
importance of clear systems for evaluating a 
wide range of AR/VR applications, particularly 
health and medical solutions. In addition, 
as Erika Peace of Unity Technologies noted, 
policymakers and implementing organizations 
should work with developers to determine 
how best to integrate these technologies 
into existing IT systems. This will accelerate 
adoption in key areas, including government 
operations and public services, workplace 
training and collaboration, and education.
As AR/VR innovation expands to new use 
cases and user bases, developers and 
implementers—whether they be private 
companies, public sector organizations, or 
individuals—will need a strong knowledge 
base to build and utilize these tools safely 
and effectively. There is still a notable lack 
of research or evidence base in many of the 
areas discussed above. For example, there 
is insufficient research to understand how 
children might experience AR/VR differently 
from adults, how these technologies might 
impact their mental health or cognitive 
development, and how to best integrate 
these solutions into established pedagogical 
approaches to optimize learning outcomes. 
In addition, many speakers noted that the 
evidence base for return on investment (ROI) 
from AR/VR solutions is lacking, particularly 
outside of well-established uses such as in 
advanced manufacturing or training. “[If] you 
show there is an ROI, monetarily, for some of 
these technologies, that will help push this 
forward,” noted Diane Hickey , SBIR/STTR Program Director at the National Science 
Foundation.
Because these technologies are still relatively 
unknown to many and new to most, 
technological innovation should be 
accompanied by efforts to educate consumers 
and policymakers, upskill workers who could 
benefit from these technologies, and prepare 
rising generations for success in a world where 
virtual and physical reality play equally 
important roles in their daily lives. Scott Evans 
of Microsoft also observed that the new 
technology itself is not necessary the 
challenge—it’s “how to re-train people how to 
change operations, how to change procedures 
and a way of working that sometimes has been 
ingrained for many decades.” Thus, guidance 
for change management within companies and 
institutions will be just as important as 
building out a skilled workforce that can utilize 
AR/VR solutions. 
 
“This is such a new technology, 
we’ve got to make sure that we’re 
making this available to everyone, 
we’re considering people who 
have different abilities, different 
price points, all of these things.” 
 
– Erika Peace, Senior Industry Product 
Manager for Government, Unity 
Technologies
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION FOUNDATION 8“As new technologies enter the 
marketplace, one challenge is 
informing and educating members 
of Congress about these cutting-
edge technology developments, 
as well as the benefits—and 
concerns—that come with them.” 
 
– Representative Suzan DelBene, 
Co-Chair, Congressional Caucus 
on Virtual, Augmented, and Mixed 
Realities
All of this should be part of a larger effort to 
ensure U.S. competitiveness in this immersive 
future. AR/VR “has a growing and important 
place in the minds of legislators when it 
comes to innovation and global 
competitiveness,” observed Elizabeth Hyman 
of the XR Association. Although the United 
States is home to many leading 
innovators in this space, 
ongoing leadership in the 
global AR/VR 
ecosystem is not 
guaranteed. Indeed, 
“the U.S. has, to a 
certain extent, ceded 
a lot of the power, 
both in terms of the 
development of these 
industries as well as 
the content creation 
therein,” argued Ash Richter of In-Q-Tel. She pointed to mass 
digitization in the Asia-Pacific region and 
policy developments in Europe as two areas 
where the U.S. is falling behind. Policymakers 
should work with industry to establish policies 
and invest in initiatives that encourage 
innovation and promote widespread adoption 
of AR/VR to solidify U.S. leadership in a more 
immersive future.
CONCLUSION
AR/VR technologies are proliferating in every 
aspect of everyday life, from entertainment 
and communication to workforce development 
and education. These technologies have 
transformative potential—but they also raise 
unique considerations in key areas such 
as privacy, safety, security, and equity that 
policymakers are already grappling with 
in relation to existing technologies. The 
conversations at the AR/VR Policy Conference 
brought many of these considerations to light 
and demonstrated the importance of including 
these technologies in ongoing policy debates 
about how to regulate the technologies that 
shape our lives.
